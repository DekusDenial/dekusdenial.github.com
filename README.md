MY GITHUB PAGE

This will host some of my web applications, as well as the V2.0 of my online portfolio.

Developers
----------

You can use the Rakefile with convenience methods for working with the Bootstrap library.

+ **build** - `rake build`
This will run Sass on the /lib directory and generate `bootstrap-2.0.1.css`, `bootstrap-2.0.1.min.css`, `bootstrap-responsive-2.0.1.css` and `bootstrap-responsive-2.0.1.min.css`

+ **watch** - `rake watch`
This is a convenience method for watching your Sass files and automatically building them whenever you save.
